### What Happens Next:

1. **Vercel Auto-Deploy** 🔄
   - Vercel will detect the new push
   - Automatically trigger a new deployment
   - Build and deploy your free version

2. **Environment Variables** ⚠️
   You can now **REMOVE** these from Vercel:
   - ❌ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - ❌ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID`
   
   Keep these:

3. **Database Migration** 🗄️
   Vercel will automatically run:
   ```bash
   prisma generate
   ```
   The database schema is already up to date (no changes needed).

   - Add a contact named "John Doe"

2. **Mobile:**
   - Login with same email: `test@example.com`
   - Verify "John Doe" appears
   - Add contact "Jane Smith"

3. **Desktop:**
   - Refresh page
   - Verify "Jane Smith" now appears
   - ✨ Everything syncs!
