2. Click "Start now" and create your account
3. Complete the account verification process

---

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
2. You'll see two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
3. Keep these keys safe - you'll need them in Step 5

---

## Step 3: Create Your Product and Price

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products
2. Click **"Add product"**
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Name**: "My Contacts Pro Plan" (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "Monthly subscription for unlimited contacts management"
   - **Pricing**: Select "Recurring"
   - **Price**: 1.99
   - **Currency**: EUR
   - **Billing period**: Monthly
4. Click **"Save product"**
5. After saving, you'll see a **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)
6. **Copy this Price ID** - you'll need it in Step 5

---

## Step 4: Set Up Webhook (for subscription events)

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. Enter your endpoint URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
   *(For production, use your actual domain)*
4. Click **"Select events"** and choose:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `invoice.payment_failed`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. After creation, click on the webhook to reveal the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
7. **Copy this Signing secret** - you'll need it in Step 5

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. In your project root, create a file named `.env.local` (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add the following variables with YOUR keys:

```env
# Database (already set)
POSTGRES_URL="file:./dev.db"

# Stripe Keys (from Step 2)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

# Stripe Webhook Secret (from Step 4)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE

# Stripe Price ID (from Step 3)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID_HERE

# App URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

3. **Replace** the placeholder values with your actual keys
4. Save the file

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env.local` to git! It contains sensitive keys.

---

## Step 6: Restart Your Development Server

1. Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart it:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Step 7: Test the Subscription Flow

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click **"Subscribe Now - ‚Ç¨1.99/mo"**
3. You'll be redirected to the pricing page
4. Click **"Subscribe Now"**
5. Use Stripe's test card number:
   ```
   Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Expiry date: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
   CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)
   ```
6. Complete the checkout
7. You should be redirected to your contacts page

---

## Step 8: Test Webhooks Locally (Optional but Recommended)

For webhooks to work on localhost, use Stripe CLI:

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # Or download from https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
   ```

2. Login to Stripe:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Forward webhooks to your local server:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

4. The CLI will display a webhook signing secret starting with `whsec_`
5. Update your `.env.local` file with this new `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
6. Keep the CLI running while testing

---

## Step 9: Go Live (When Ready)

1. Complete your Stripe account activation
2. In Stripe Dashboard, toggle from "Test mode" to "Live mode"
3. Get your LIVE API keys from https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
4. Create a new product/price in Live mode (same as Step 3)
5. Set up webhook endpoint with your production domain
6. Update `.env.local` (or production environment variables) with LIVE keys
7. **Remove the `_test_` keys and use `pk_live_` and `sk_live_` keys**

---

## üéâ You're All Set!

Your subscription system is now configured!

### What Happens Next:

‚úÖ Users see the pricing page with ‚Ç¨1.99/month plan
‚úÖ They can subscribe via Stripe Checkout
‚úÖ After payment, they get access to the contacts app
‚úÖ Webhooks handle subscription updates automatically
‚úÖ Cancellations are handled through Stripe Customer Portal

---

## üìù Additional Features to Add (Optional)

### 1. **Subscription Check in Contacts Page**
Currently, the contacts page is accessible after login. You may want to add subscription validation:

```typescript
// Add this to /app/contacts/page.tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const checkSubscription = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/check-subscription');
    const { hasActiveSubscription } = await response.json();
    
    if (!hasActiveSubscription) {
      router.push('/pricing');
    }
  };
  
  checkSubscription();
}, []);
```

### 2. **Customer Portal for Subscription Management**
Allow users to manage their subscription:
- Cancel subscription
- Update payment method
- View billing history

This requires setting up Stripe Customer Portal in your dashboard.

### 3. **Database Integration**
Store subscription status in your database:
- Add `Subscription` model to Prisma schema
- Track subscription ID, status, current period end
- Update via webhooks

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Checkout not working?
