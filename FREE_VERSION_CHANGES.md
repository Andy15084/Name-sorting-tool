3. On next visit, automatically logged in
4. Works across browser sessions
5. Stays logged in even after closing browser

### When Disabled:
1. User doesn't check "Keep me signed in"
2. Credentials stored only in `sessionStorage`
3. Logged out when browser/tab is closed
4. Must login again on next visit

### Logout:
- Clicking "Logout" clears both session and persistent login
- User must login again
